# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of classic Machine Learning algorithms built from scratch using only NumPy (no high-level ML libraries such as scikit-learn).

The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematical foundations and internal mechanics of each algorithm.

## 📚 Implemented Algorithms

- K-Means Clustering
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (Feedforward)

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand machine learning algorithms at a low level
- Practice linear algebra and probability concepts
- Strengthen Python and NumPy skills
- Build strong ML fundamentals without relying on black-box libraries

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy

## 📌 Why From Scratch?

Implementing algorithms from scratch helps develop:

- Mathematical intuition
- Debugging skills
- Deeper understanding of optimization
- Stronger problem-solving ability
